    "#### **Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a sequence as A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, ... A<sub>n</sub>, a longest increasing subsequence would always look something like the following: A<sub>a</sub>, A<sub>b</sub>, ..., A<sub>i</sub> where i is the position we are looking at right now (1 ≤ i ≤ n).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let A<sub>j</sub> be the one we found before A<sub>i</sub>. Because we find a subsequence, j and i does not have to be consecutive. We have a condition where j < i and A[j] < A[i].\n",
    "\n",
    "We will have the following subsequence and keep looking for the longest subsequence until i reaches n (but the subsequence doesn't have to include A<sub>n</sub> of course). A<sub>a</sub>, A<sub>b</sub>, ..., A<sub>j</sub>, A<sub>i</sub>\n",
    "\n",
    "We look for 1 ≤ j < i for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Base case:\n",
    "- A[i]\n",
    "\n",
    "Equation: ```D[i] = max(D[j]) + 1``` where ```D[i]``` is the length of the longest increasing subsequence of a sequence A until the position i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n and j < i and A[j] < A[i]."
